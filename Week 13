This week we looked at REDUX and looked at some tutorials on the REDUX.JS.ORG in the get started sections.
The tutorials looked at Actions, Reducers, Stores, Data flow and REDUXs usage with React.
From what I understand, Actions are used to send data to the Store, Reducers specify how the state 
changes, Store is where the state is stored (I think) and the data flow is the flow of the Actions, 
Reducers and Stores.
