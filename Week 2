This week we learned about github and the git terminal in VSCode. We learnt many git commands like commit, create a branch 
and also push and pull. For our little group project, we were able to pull an updated copy of the repository which would download
all the files from the repository onto our local machines. 

Each member of the team were able to work on different parts of the website using branches and then merging and pushing their
changes to the master branch.
