This week we looked at Express.js which is a framework used by developers. A framework
we used was Node.js. 

The first task was to install Express.js of which was relatively to install. I followed
the instructions from the Express application generator guide. We learnt how to check which
version we were on (express --version) and how to keep our Express.js upto date. We then had 
to create a project folder on our systems which would create a package.json file in the folder.
 {
  "name": "hello world",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "dependencies": {
    "address": "^1.1.0",
    "express": "^4.16.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {},
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Carlos",
  "license": "ISC"
}

This is the contents of the package.json file I made.

We then had to create a file called server.js in the same project folder and the contents look like this

const express = require('express')
let app = express()

app.all('*', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Welcome to WEB601!')
})

app.listen(3000, 
  () => {console.log('Open at localhost:3000')}
)

Session 2 

1.Require statement 
2.Middleware 
3.routes 
4.Application 

Restaurant used as an example 

Middleware 

This is part of express 
app.use(('/table'),function(req,res,next)){ 
User booking = req.booking 
User age = req.age 
if(booking && age){ 
  Next() 
  } 
}) 

Next in function will procced to next function 

Function refactored 
App.use('/table',(req,res,next)=>{ 
Var age = req.age 
Var booking = req.booking 
If(age && booking){ 
  Next() 
  } 
}) 
 
Routes 

Checks if there are any tables available  
App.get('/table/:amount', function(req,res,next) { 
Var dinner = req.params.amount 
Res.send('looking for table' + dinner + '!') 
}) 

Req = { 
P : { 
Amount : 4 
 } 
} 

Const express = require('express'); 
Const tableRoute = express.Router() 
TableRoute.Use (function(req,res,next){ 
Var booking = req.booking 
Var age = req.age 
If(booking && age){ 
Next() 
  } 
}) 

TableRoute.use('/bar',function(req,res,next){ 
Var age = req.age 
If(age >= 18){ 
Next() 
}) 

 

If want to show a message 
App.listen(3000){ 
  Console.log('Running port 3000') 
}
