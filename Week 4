This week we looked at Express.js which is a framework used by developers. A framework
we used was Node.js. 

The first task was to install Express.js of which was relatively to install. I followed
the instructions from the Express application generator guide. We learnt how to check which
version we were on (express --version) and how to keep our Express.js upto date. We then had 
to create a project folder on our systems which would create a package.json file in the folder.
 {
  "name": "hello world",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "dependencies": {
    "address": "^1.1.0",
    "express": "^4.16.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {},
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Carlos",
  "license": "ISC"
}

This is the contents of the package.json file I made.

We then had to create a file called server.js in the same project folder and the contents look like this

const express = require('express')
let app = express()

app.all('*', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Welcome to WEB601!')
})

app.listen(3000, 
  () => {console.log('Open at localhost:3000')}
)
