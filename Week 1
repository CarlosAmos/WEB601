The first week involved getting everything we need for this course. For this course we would be using GITHUB which is used for uploading 
your projects onto GITHUB and allows you to collaborate with other people. I think GITHUB is a great system as projects are uploaded online and 
can constantly work and can update the files with a command. We will also be using Node.js terminal for creating our app. The only knowledge 
I have of web development prior to this course is using HTML and CSS.
